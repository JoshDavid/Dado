# AcreTools
AcreTools is a collection of functions for working with Acre projects that exist outside of Acre itself. Some of them may be candidates for for enhancements to Acre. Some of them are required for runtime and need to work with and without Acre.

Some of these tools are for creating packages. A **package** is (or is proposed to be) a distributable version of the project. A package is the GitHub release.  A package contains a workspace containing all of the code for the project, and any dependent projects.
