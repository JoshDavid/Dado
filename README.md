# AcreTools
This is an exploratory project. 

AcreTools is a collection of functions for working with Acre projects.  AcreTools obviously exist outside of Acre itself. Some of the functions may be candidates for for enhancements to Acre. Some of them are required for runtime and need to work with and without Acre.

Some of these tools are for creating packages. A **package** is (or is proposed to be) a distributable version of the project. A package is the GitHub release. A package is for other APL programmers, to use and embed in their own projects. It is not end-user application.  A package contains a workspace with all of the code for the project. A package must also contain all of the resources for the project - dlls, images, etc. A package does NOT contain any dependent packages.

As functions take shape and become import parts of my (Paul Mansour) daily work, they will be documented on the wiki pages.
