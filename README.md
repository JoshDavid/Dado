# AcreTools
AcreTools is a collection of User Commands for working with Acre projects and Git (and GitHub).

AcreTools defines a **package** and an **application**, building on the concept of a **project** which is defined by Acre. A package is a versioned release of the project. It is simply a stripped down version of the project, with development code and assests removed. An **application** is a collection of packages (one primary package and a set of zero or more dependent packages), where the source code is delivered in a single workspace.

AcreTools defines **AcreFlow** a very simple Git workflow, specifically for small APL development teams.
