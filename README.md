# AcreTools
This is an exploratory project. 

AcreTools is a collection of functions for working with Acre projects.  AcreTools obviously exist outside of Acre itself. Some of the functions may be candidates for for enhancements to Acre. Some of them are required for runtime and need to work with and without Acre.

Some of these tools are for creating packages and applications. A **package** is a distributable version of the project. A package is the GitHub release. A package is for other APL programmers, to use and embed in their own projects. A package is simply a stripped down version of the project, stripped of development code and assets. It is not an  end-user application.  

An **application** is a collection of packages, where the source code is delivered in a single workspace. It is not, by itself, an end-user application.  

As functions take shape and become an important part of my (Paul Mansour) daily work, they will be documented on the wiki pages.
